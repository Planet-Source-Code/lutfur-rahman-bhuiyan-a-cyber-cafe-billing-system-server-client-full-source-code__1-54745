CalendarVB was going to be a financial type of calendar control for a customer of ours, but ended up not being used. So rather than just having it lying around collecting dust, we've decided to release the controls code as unsupported freeware, to do with as you wish. The control uses VB's date functions and date data type, so it should be Y2K compliant. (according to Microsoft anyway. The testing that we did do with the control would seem to support this.)

The CalendarVB has 3 styles, Month, Week, and Period. Period is totally customizable and allows the programmer to specify the number of periods per year and the number of weeks for each period. The periods must be defined at the code level, the default is 13 periods, 4 weeks each.

Have Fun!

The License code was based on Jose Mojica's book ActiveX Controls with Visual Basic 5.0, published by IDG Books WorldWide, Inc.
