'This module is needed because it provides a WinProc used for subclassing.  Tooltips
'must be provided in this manner because VB5's tooltips for an intrinsic
'control does not work with the SetCapture API in use.  Also, VB's provided
'tooltip is container provided.  Therefore, if a control is used in a
'container that does not provide a tooltiptext property on the extender
'object, the tooltip would not be provided.  The tooltip in this control is
'provided regardless of the container hosting it.
